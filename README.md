# Notes from the CP Trenches
This is the official repo for the "Notes from the CP Trenches" book.

This doc will be the compilation of my notes from the the ’90 DAYS CP Challenge’ that my brain cooked up at 3 in the morning.
If you’re somehow reading this, then maybe you’re in a similar situation that I’m in. Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out together. I’ll try to explain the key topics that I’ll cover during this challenge as if you’re my ’chaddi-buddy.’ I’ll also have 2-3 exercises for you at the end of each
topic. Hopefully, by the end, both you and I can get a CF rating of 1700+.

# Goal: build intuition, spot patterns, and enjoy problem-solving.

Think of this as a companion notebook — part diary, part guide — for anyone looking to learn CP. (This line is GPT generated lol)
