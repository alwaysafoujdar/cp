I would like to start by saying-- I'm stupid! But I'm learning. This doc will be the compilation of my notes from the the '90 DAYS CP Challenge' that my brain cooked up at 3 in the morning. If you're somehow reading this, then maybe you're in a similar situation that I'm in. Don't worry, we'll figure this out together. I'll try to explain the key topics that I'll cover during this challenge as if you're my \textit{'chaddi-buddy.'} I'll also have 2-3 exercises for you at the end of each topic. Hopefully, by the end, both you and I can get a CF rating of 1700+.

\textbf{Goal:} build intuition, spot patterns, and enjoy problem-solving.

Think of this as a companion notebook — part diary, part guide — for anyone looking to learn CP. (This line is GPT generated lol)
