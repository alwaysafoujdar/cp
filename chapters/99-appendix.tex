\section*{Passing by reference:}
\[
\texttt{for (auto \&it : v) cin >> it;}
\]

The ampersand \& is super important here. It means you're using a reference to the actual element in the vector \texttt{v}.  
This allows you to directly change its value.  

If you left it out (\texttt{for (auto it : v)}), it would just be a copy, and changing it wouldn't change the original vector at all.
